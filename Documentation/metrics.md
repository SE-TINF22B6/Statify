## Measurements

### 1. Introduction

In this section, we present the various metrics measured for our project, detailing the methodologies and tools used for each assessment. The metrics cover key aspects such as performance, code quality, and coupling, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the project's overall health and efficiency. The software tools employed for these measurements include Google Lighthouse for performance testing, SonarQube for code quality analysis, and CodeMR Metrics for coupling indicators.

### 2. Measurement Results and Analysis
#### 2.1 Performance Test with Google Lighthouse
We use the Lighthouse web extension to assess our website's rendering and response performance. The following screenshots show the results of our application:

#### 2.2 Code Quality Test with SonarQube
High-quality code is the backbone of any robust software application. To analyze the current state of our source code, we use SonarQube. Here you can see the results:

#### 2.3 Coupling Test with CodeMR Metrics
We utilized the 'CodeMR Metrics' IntelliJ extension to measure various coupling indicators:
