# Project Vision

The web application allows the connection to a user's Spotify account to access their listening history. It is used to provide statistics about their listening habits, such as most-listened-to genres, artists, and time of day, etc..

# Spotify Web API
The Spotify Web API allows developers to access and interact with Spotify's vast music catalog and user-related data. With this API, developers can create applications that can perform tasks like retrieving information about tracks, albums, and artists, managing user playlists, analyzing music content, and generating music recommendations. It enables developers to integrate Spotify's music data and services into their own web and mobile applications, making it easier to build music-related apps and services on top of the Spotify platform.
